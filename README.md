**DS_Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly**

##Phonepe

The rise of digital payments in India has been nothing short of extraordinary, spanning from major cities to the most remote villages. This payments revolution is fueled by the widespread adoption of mobile phones, mobile internet, and cutting-edge payments infrastructure developed as public goods by the central bank and government. Established in December 2015, PhonePe has significantly benefited from the API-driven digital transformation in payments across India. From the outset, we sought detailed and reliable data on digital payments in the country. PhonePe Pulse is our way of contributing back to the digital payments ecosystem.

##Phonepe Pulse

PhonePe, a leading fintech platform in India, has unveiled PhonePe Pulse, the country's first interactive website that offers comprehensive data, insights, and trends related to digital payments. The PhonePe Pulse platform features an interactive map of India, showcasing over 2000 crore transactions made by consumers. With a market share exceeding 45%, PhonePe's data provides a clear reflection of the nation’s digital payment behaviors.

The insights presented on the website and in the accompanying report are derived from two primary sources: PhonePe’s extensive transaction data, and interviews with merchants and customers. The report is freely available for download on the PhonePe Pulse website and GitHub.

##Problem Statement:

The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository houses extensive data on various metrics and statistics. The objective is to extract and process this data to derive insights and information that can be visualized in an intuitive and user-friendly way.

##Overview:

This Streamlit web app allows you to explore and visualize PhonePe Pulse data, offering insights into transaction volumes, user numbers, the top 10 states, districts, and pincodes, as well as brand popularity. The app utilizes bar charts, pie charts, and geo-map visualizations to present these insights.

##Take Away Skills:

The following skills were acquired from the project:

-GITHUB CLONING

-PYTHON

-PANDAS

-MYSQL

-STREAMLIT

-PLOTLY

##Work Flow:

Data Extraction: Automate the cloning of the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository using scripting to fetch and store the data in formats like CSV or JSON.

Data Transformation: Utilize Python and libraries like Pandas to preprocess and clean the data, handling missing values and formatting it for analysis and visualization.

Database Insertion: Use the mysql-connector-python library to connect to a MySQL database, inserting the transformed data via SQL commands.

Dashboard Creation: Develop an engaging dashboard using Python with Streamlit for the user interface and Plotly for visualization. Leverage Plotly's geolocation features to display data on a map and incorporate dropdown menus in Streamlit for user interaction.

Data Retrieval: Connect to the MySQL database using mysql-connector-python to fetch data into a Pandas DataFrame and dynamically update the dashboard.

Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. After thorough testing, deploy the dashboard publicly for user access.

##Usage of App:

After the project has been successfully set up and activated, users can interact with the Streamlit application through a web browser. Through the application's user-friendly interface, users can carry out the following tasks:

The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics ,fetch data and preprocess it.

Gather information and keep it in a SQL data warehouse for numerous metrics.

Check out the uploaded transaction / user details.

Utilise a variety of search tools to locate and retrieve data from a SQL database.

Use these integrated features and geo visualisation techniques to perform analysis and visualisation of pulse data.

##Conclusion:

The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. This solution aims to deliver valuable insights for analysis and informed decision-making.
